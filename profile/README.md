Spellhold Studios (SHS) is a community committed to creating mods for different Computer Role Playing Games (CRPGs), including Baldur's Gate II and other games using the Infinity Engine, The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion, and Neverwinter Nights 1 (the Aurora Engine).

On a more technical note, the community is developing mods for Baldur's Gate and hosting them both at our <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/files/">official Download Center</a> and here. Don't hesitate to <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/">join us</a> and contribute to these works which allow other players to benefit from a new look on the game!
