## SHS Moved to a New GitHub Organization

Spellhold Studios has changed its GitHub account. The owner of the previous (i.e. this) organization and a prolific IE modder, Gwendolyne, disappeared suddenly in 2022, unfortunately without appointing a successor who could effectively maintain our modding projects here. Sadly, all attempts to contact Gwendolyne or restore full access through GitHub Support have been to no avail, which is why we have decided to create a new account.

All SHS mods have been forked or transferred to the new organization, which will be maintained by trusted, friendly, and open-minded Staff members. We recognize this as an initial inconvenience to Modders, but we hope our efforts put into preserving the community's legacy make up for it.

The new organization is available at: [github.com/Spellhold-Studios](https://github.com/Spellhold-Studios)

A complementary [Index of Mods](https://spellhold-studios.github.io/) will be updated with links and descriptions.

To help our members and visitors reach us more easily, we have also enabled two communication channels: [SHS Discord server](https://discord.gg/pE2Njbdb2a) and [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/Spellhold-Studios/discussions).

We hope to see you there!
